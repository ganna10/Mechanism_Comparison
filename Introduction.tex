%what is tropospheric O3 & its importance
Ground-level ozone (\ce{O3}) is both an air pollutant and a climate forcer that is detrimental to human health and crop growth \citep{Stevenson:2013}. 
\ce{O3} is produced from the reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (\ce{NO_x} = NO + \ce{NO2}) in the presence of sunlight \citep{Atkinson:2000}.

Background \ce{O3} concentrations have increased during the last several decades due to the increase of overall global anthropogenic emissions of \ce{O3} precursors \citep{HTAP:2010}.
Despite decreases in emissions of \ce{O3} precursors over Europe since 1990, \citet{AQEU:2014} reports that $98$\% of Europe's urban population are exposed to levels exceeding the WHO air quality guideline of \mbox{$100$ $\mu$g m$^{-3}$} over an \mbox{$8$-hour} mean.
These exceedances result from local and regional \ce{O3} precursor gas emissions, their intercontinental transport and the non-linear relationship of \ce{O3} concentrations to \ce{NO_x} and VOC levels \citep{AQEU:2014}.

Effective strategies for emission reductions rely on accurate predictions of \ce{O3} concentrations using chemical transport models (CTMs). 
These predictions require adequate representation of gas-phase chemistry in the chemical mechanism used by the CTM. 
For reasons of computational efficiency, the chemical mechanisms used by global and regional CTMs must be simpler than the nearly-explicit mechanisms which can be used in box modelling studies.
This study compares the impacts of different simplification approaches of chemical mechanisms on \ce{O3} production chemistry focusing on the role of VOC degradation products.

%NOx-VOC-chemistry
The photochemical cycle (\reactionref{r:NO_O3}--\reactionref{r:O2_O3P}) rapidly produces and destroys \ce{O3}.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{NO + O3}}{\ce{NO2 + O2}}{new}{r:NO_O3}
    \reactionitem{\ce{NO2 + h$\nu$}}{\ce{NO + O(^3P)}}{new}{r:NO2_hv}
    \reactionitem{\ce{O2 + O(^3P) + M}}{\ce{O3 + M}}{new}{r:O2_O3P}
\end{reactionlist}
NO and \ce{NO2} reach a near-steady state via \reactionref{r:NO_O3} and \reactionref{r:NO2_hv} which is disturbed in two cases. 
Firstly, via \ce{O3} removal (deposition or \reactionref{r:NO_O3} during night-time and near large NO sources) and secondly, when \ce{O3} is produced through VOC--\ce{NO_x} chemistry \citep{Sillman:1999}.

VOCs (RH) are oxidised in the troposphere by the hydoxyl radical (OH) forming peroxy radicals (\ce{RO2}) in the presence of \ce{O2} \reactionref{r:RH_OH}. 
In high-\ce{NO_x} conditions, typical of urban environments, \ce{RO2} react with NO \reactionref{r:RO2_NO} to form alkoxy radicals (RO), which react quickly with \ce{O2} \reactionref{r:RO_O2} producing a hydroperoxy radical (\ce{HO2}) and a carbonyl species (R$^{\prime}$CHO).
The secondary chemistry of these first generation carbon-containing oxidation products is analogous to the sequence \reactionref{r:RH_OH}--\reactionref{r:RO_O2}, producing further \ce{HO2} and \ce{RO2} radicals.
Subsequent generation oxidation products can continue to react, producing \ce{HO2} and \ce{RO2} until they have been completely oxidised to \ce{CO2} and \ce{H2O}.
Both \ce{RO2} and \ce{HO2} react with NO to produce \ce{NO2} (\reactionref{r:RO2_NO} and \reactionref{r:HO2_NO}) leading to \ce{O3} production via \reactionref{r:NO2_hv} and \reactionref{r:O2_O3P}. 
Thus the amount of \ce{O3} produced from VOC degradation is related to the number of NO to \ce{NO2} conversions by \ce{RO2} and \ce{HO2} radicals formed during VOC degradation \citep{Atkinson:2000}.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RH + OH + O2}}{\ce{RO2 + H2O}}{new}{r:RH_OH}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RO2 + NO}}{\ce{RO + NO2}}{new}{r:RO2_NO}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RO + O2}}{\ce{R$^{\prime}$CHO + HO2}}{new}{r:RO_O2}
    \reactionitem{\ce{HO2 + NO}}{\ce{OH + NO2}}{new}{r:HO2_NO}
\end{reactionlist}

% NOx and VOC sensitive regimes
Three atmospheric regimes with respect to \ce{O3} production can be defined \citep{Jenkin:2000}. 
In the \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime, VOC concentrations are much higher than those of \ce{NO_x} and \ce{O3} production depends on \ce{NO_x} concentrations. 
On the other hand, when \ce{NO_x} concentrations are much higher than those of VOC (VOC-sensitive regime), VOC concentrations determine the amount of \ce{O3} produced.
Finally, the \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive regime produces maximal \ce{O3} and is controlled by both VOC and \ce{NO_x} concentrations.

These atmospheric regimes remove radicals through distinct mechanisms \citep{Kleinman:1991}. 
In the \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime, radical concentrations are high relative to \ce{NO_x} leading to radical removal by radical combination reactions \reactionref{r:RO2_HO2} and bimolecular destruction reactions \reactionref{r:HO2_OH} \citep{Kleinman:1994}.
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RO2 + HO2}}{\ce{ROOH + O2}}{new}{r:RO2_HO2}
    \reactionitem{\ce{HO2 + OH}}{\ce{H2O + O2}}{new}{r:HO2_OH}
\end{reactionlist}
Whereas in the VOC-sensitive regime, radicals are removed by reacting with \ce{NO2} leading to nitric acid (\ce{HNO3}) \reactionref{r:NO2_OH} and PAN species \reactionref{r:RC(O)O2_NO2}.
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{NO2 + OH}}{\ce{HNO3}}{new}{r:NO2_OH}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RC(O)O2 + NO2}}{\ce{RC(O)O2NO2}}{new}{r:RC(O)O2_NO2}
\end{reactionlist}
The \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive regime has no dominant radical removal mechanism as radical and \ce{NO_x} amounts are comparable.
This chemistry results in \ce{O3} concentrations being a non-linear function of \ce{NO_x} and VOC concentrations.

%OPP 
Individual VOC impact \ce{O3} production differently through their diverse reaction rates and degradation pathways. 
These impacts can be quantified using Ozone Production Potentials (OPP) which can be calculated through incremental reactivity (IR) studies using photochemical models. 
In IR studies, VOC concentrations are changed by a known increment and the change in \ce{O3} production is compared to that of a standard VOC mixture. 
Examples of IR scales are the Maximal Incremental Reactivity (MIR) and Maximum Ozone Incremental Reactivity (MOIR) scales in \citet{Carter:1994}, as well as the Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) scale of \citet{Derwent:1996} and \citet{Derwent:1998}. 
The MIR, MOIR and POCP scales were calculated under different \ce{NO_x} conditions, thus calculating OPPs in different atmospheric regimes.

\citet{Butler:2011} calculate the maximum potential of VOC to produce \ce{O3} by using \ce{NO_x} conditions inducing \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive chemistry over multi-day scenarios using a ``tagging'' approach -- the Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP). 
Tagging involves labelling all organic degradation products produced during VOC degradation with the name of the emitted VOC.
Tagging enables the attribution of \ce{O3} production from VOC degradation products back to the emitted VOC, thus providing a detailed insight into VOC degradation chemistry.
\citet{Butler:2011} showed that some VOC, such as alkanes, produce maximum \ce{O3} on the second day of the model run; in contrast to unsaturated aliphatic and aromatic VOC which produce maximum \ce{O3} on the first day.
In this study, the tagging approach of \citet{Butler:2011} is applied to several chemical mechanisms, using conditions of maximum \ce{O3} production (\ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive regime), to compare the effects of different representations of VOC degradation chemistry on \ce{O3} production in the different chemical mechanisms.

%chemical mechanisms are how they have to represent O3 chemistry
A near-explicit mechanism, such as the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) \citep{Jenkin:2003, Saunders:2003, Bloss:2005}, includes detailed degradation chemistry making the MCM ideal as a reference for comparing chemical mechanisms.
Reduced mechanisms generally take two approaches to simplifying the representation of VOC degradation chemistry: lumped structure approaches; and lumped molecule approaches \citep{Dodge:2000}. 

Lumped structure mechanisms speciate VOC by the carbon bonds of the emitted VOC, examples are the Carbon Bond mechanisms, CBM-IV \citep{Gery:1989} and CB05 \citep{Yarwood:2005}.
Lumped molecule mechanisms represent VOC explicitly or by aggregating (lumping) many VOC into a single mechanism species.
Mechanism species may lump VOC by functionality (MOdel for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers, MOZART-4 \citep{Emmons:2010}) or OH-reactivity (Regional Acid Deposition Model, RADM2 \citep{Stockwell:1990}, Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanisms, RACM \citep{Stockwell:1997} and RACM2 \citep{Goliff:2013}).
The Common Representative Intermediates mechanism (CRI) lumps the degradation products of VOC rather than the emitted VOC \citep{Jenkin:2008}.

%other chemical mechanism comparison studies
Many comparison studies of chemical mechanisms consider modelled time series of \ce{O3} concentrations over varying VOC and \ce{NO_x} concentrations.
Examples are \citet{Dunker:1984}, \citet{Kuhn:1998} and \citet{Emmerson:2009}.
The largest discrepancies between the time series of \ce{O3} concentrations in different mechanisms from these studies arise when modelling urban rather than rural conditions and are attributed to the treatment of radical production, organic nitrate and night-time chemistry.
\citet{Emmerson:2009} also compare the inorganic gas-phase chemistry of different chemical mechanisms, differences in inorganic chemistry arise from inconsistencies between IUPAC and JPL reaction rate constants.

Mechanisms have also been compared using OPP scales.
OPPs are a useful comparison tool as they relate \ce{O3} production to a single value. 
\citet{Derwent:2010} compared the near-explicit \mbox{MCM v3.1} and SAPRC-07 mechanisms using first-day POCP values calculated under VOC-sensitive conditions. 
The POCP values were comparable between the mechanisms.  
\citet{Butler:2011} compared first day TOPP values to the corresponding published MIR, MOIR and POCP values.
TOPP values were most comparable to MOIR and POCP values due to the similarity of the chemical regimes used in their calculation. 

In this study, we compare TOPP values of VOC using a number of mechanisms to those calculated with the MCM v3.2. 
Differences in \ce{O3} production are explained by the differing treatments of secondary VOC degradation in these mechanisms.
