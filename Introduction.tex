%what is tropospheric O3 & its importance
Ground-level ozone (\ce{O3}) is both an air pollutant and a short-lived climate forcing pollutant (SLCP) that is detrimental to human health and crop growth \citep{AQEU:2014}. 
\ce{O3} is not directly emitted but produced from the reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (\ce{NO_x} = NO + \ce{NO2}) in the presence of sunlight \citep{Atkinson:2000}.

Background \ce{O3} concentrations have increased due to the overall global increase in anthropogenic emissions of \ce{O3} precursors \citep{HTAP:2010}.
Despite decreases in emissions of \ce{O3} precursors over Europe, $98$\% of Europe's urban population are exposed to levels exceeding the WHO air quality guideline of \mbox{$100$ $\mu$g/m$^3$} over an \mbox{$8$-hour} mean \citep{WHO:2006}. 
These exceedances result from local and regional \ce{O3} precursor gas emissions, their intercontinental transport and the non-linear relationship of \ce{O3} concentrations on \ce{NO_x} and VOC levels \citep{AQEU:2014}.

Effective strategies for emission reductions depend on accurate predictions of \ce{O3} concentrations using chemical transport models (CTMs). 
These predictions require adequate representation of gas-phase chemistry in the chemical mechanism used by the CTM. 
All mechanisms simplify gas-phase chemistry due to the computational resourses needed for gas-phase chemistry calculations.
The scope of the modelling study determines the level of simplification --- global CTMs require more computationally efficient mechanisms than boxmodels.
This study compares the impacts of different simplificaton levels on \ce{O3} production chemistry focusing on the representation of VOC degradation products.

%NOx-VOC-chemistry
The photochemical cycle (\reactionref{r:NO_O3}--\reactionref{r:O2_O3P}) rapdily produces and destroys \ce{O3}. 
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{NO + O3}}{\ce{NO2 + O2}}{new}{r:NO_O3}
    \reactionitem{\ce{NO2 + h$\nu$}}{\ce{NO + O(^3P)}}{new}{r:NO2_hv}
    \reactionitem{\ce{O2 + O(^3P) + M}}{\ce{O3 + M}}{new}{r:O2_O3P}
\end{reactionlist}
NO and \ce{NO2} reach a near-steady state via \reactionref{r:NO_O3} and \reactionref{r:NO2_hv} which is disturbed in two cases. 
Firstly, via \ce{O3} removal (deposition or \reactionref{r:NO_O3} during night-time and near large NO sources) and secondly, when \ce{O3} is produced through VOC--\ce{NO_x} chemistry \citep{Sillman:1999}.

VOC (RH) are oxidised in the troposphere by the hydoxyl radical (OH) forming peroxy radicals (\ce{RO2}) in the presence of \ce{O2} \reactionref{r:RH_OH}. 
In high-\ce{NO_x} conditions typical of urban environments, \ce{RO2} react with NO \reactionref{r:RO2_NO} to form alkoxy radicals (RO),which react quickly with \ce{O2} \reactionref{r:RO_O2} producing a carbonyl species (R$^{\prime}$CHO) and a hydroperoxy radical (\ce{HO2}).
Both \ce{RO2} and \ce{HO2} react with NO to produce \ce{NO2} (\reactionref{r:RO2_NO} and \reactionref{r:HO2_NO}) leading to \ce{O3} production via \reactionref{r:NO2_hv} and \reactionref{r:O2_O3P}. 
Thus the amount of \ce{O3} produced from VOC degradation is related to the number of NO to \ce{NO2} conversions by \ce{RO2} and \ce{HO2} radicals \citep{Atkinson:2000}.
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RH + OH + O2}}{\ce{RO2 + H2O + O2}}{new}{r:RH_OH}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RO2 + NO}}{\ce{RO + NO2}}{new}{r:RO2_NO}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RO + O2}}{\ce{R$^{\prime}$CHO + HO2}}{new}{r:RO_O2}
    \reactionitem{\ce{HO2 + NO}}{\ce{OH + NO2}}{new}{r:HO2_NO}
\end{reactionlist}

% NOx and VOC sensitive regimes
This chemistry leads to \ce{O3} concentration being a non-linear function of \ce{NO_x} and VOC concentrations.
Three atmospheric regimes with respect to \ce{O3} production can be defined \citep{Jenkin:2000}. 
In the \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime, VOC concentrations are much higher than those of \ce{NO_x} and \ce{O3} production depends on \ce{NO_x} concentrations. 
On the other hand, when \ce{NO_x} concentrations are much higher than those of VOC (VOC-sensitive regime), VOC concentrations determine the amount of \ce{O3} produced.
Finally, the \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive regime produces maximal \ce{O3} and is controlled by both VOC and \ce{NO_x} concentrations.

These atmospheric regimes remove radicals through distinct mechanisms \citep{Kleinman:1991}. 
In the \ce{NO_x}-sensitive regime, radical concentrations are high relative to \ce{NO_x} removing radicals by radical combination reactions \reactionref{r:RO2_HO2} and bimolecular destruction reactions \reactionref{r:HO2_OH} \citep{Kleinman:1994}.
\vspace{-5mm}
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RO2 + HO2}}{\ce{ROOH + O2}}{new}{r:RO2_HO2}
    \reactionitem{\ce{HO2 + OH}}{\ce{H2O + O2}}{new}{r:HO2_OH}
\end{reactionlist}
Whereas in the VOC-sensitive regime, radicals are removed by reacting with \ce{NO2} leading to nitric acid (\ce{HNO3}) \reactionref{r:NO2_OH} and PAN species \reactionref{r:RC(O)O2_NO2}.
\vspace{-3mm}
\begin{reactionlist}
    \reactionitem{\ce{NO2 + OH}}{\ce{HNO3}}{new}{r:NO2_OH}
    \reactionitem{\ce{RC(O)O2 + NO2}}{\ce{RC(O)O2NO2}}{new}{r:RC(O)O2_NO2}
\end{reactionlist}
The \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive regime has no dominant radical removal mechanism as radical and \ce{NO_x} amounts are comparable.

%OPP 
Individual VOC impact \ce{O3} production differently through their diverse reaction rates and degradation pathways. 
These impacts are quantified using Ozone Production Potentials (OPP) which are calculated through incremental reactivity (IR) studies using photochemical models. 
In IR studies, VOC concentrations are changed by a known increment and the change in \ce{O3} production is compared to that of a standard VOC mixture. 

Examples of IR scales are the Maximal Incremental Reactivity (MIR) and Maximum Ozone Incremental Reactivity (MOIR) scales in \citet{Carter:1994}, as well as the Photochemical Ozone Creation Potential (POCP) scale of \citet{Derwent:1996} and \citet{Derwent:1998}. 
These IR scales use separate \ce{NO_x} conditions thus calculating OPPs in different atmospheric regimes.

\citet{Butler:2011} calculate OPP using a ``tagging'' approach -- the Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP). 
The TOPP measures the maximum potential of a VOC to produce \ce{O3} by using \ce{NO_x} conditions leading to \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive chemistry.
Tagging involves labelling all organic degradation products produced during VOC degradation with the name of the emitted VOC.
Thus tagging enables VOC source attribution of \ce{O3} production and a detailed insight into VOC degradation chemistry.
Tagging is applied to different chemical mechanisms comparing the different representations of VOC degradation chemistry. 

%chemical mechanisms are how they have to represent O3 chemistry
A near-explicit mechanism, such as the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) \citep{Jenkin:2003, Saunders:2003, Bloss:2005}, includes detailed degradation chemistry making the MCM ideal as a reference for comparing chemical mechanisms.
The latest version, \mbox{MCM v3.2} \citep{MCM_Site}, is the reference mechanism in this study.

Mechanisms are further simplified by using lumped structure or lumped molecule approachs \citep{Dodge:2000}. 
Lumped structure mechanisms speciate VOC by the carbon bonds of the emitted VOC, examples are the CBM-IV \citep{Gery:1989} and CB05 \citep{Yarwood:2005}.
Lumped structure mechanisms represent VOC by an explicit or a lumped species representing many VOC. 
Mechanism species may lump VOC by functionality (MOZART-4 \citep{Emmons:2010}) or OH-reactivity (RADM2 \citep{Stockwell:1990}, RACM \citep{Stockwell:1997}, RACM2 \citep{Goliff:2013}).
The CRI lumps the degradation products of VOC instead of the emitted VOC \citep{Jenkin:2008}.

%other chemical mechanism comparison studies
Many comparison studies of chemical mechanisms consider modelled time series of \ce{O3} concentrations over varying VOC and \ce{NO_x} concentrations, examples are \citet{Dunker:1984}, \citet{Kuhn:1998} and \citet{Emmerson:2009}.
The largest discrepancies between the time series of \ce{O3} concentrations in different mechanisms arise when modelling urban rather than rural conditions and are attributed to the treatment of radical production, organic nitrate and night-time chemistry.

Mechanisms have been compared using IR scales.
\citet{Derwent:2010} compares the near-explicit MCM v3.1 and SAPRC-07 mechanisms using first-day POCP values calculated under VOC-sensitive conditions. 
The POCP values were comparable between the mechanisms. 

OPPs are a useful comparison tool as they relate \ce{O3} production to a single value. 
\citet{Butler:2011} compares first day TOPP values to the corresponding MIR, MOIR and POCP values.
TOPP values were most comparable to MOIR and POCP values.  
We compare TOPP values for VOC using a number of mechanisms to those calculated with the MCM v3.2. 
Differences in \ce{O3} production are explained by the treatment of VOC degradation.
