The chemical mechanisms are outlined in Table \ref{t:mechanisms}. 
This includes mechanisms used for global and regional modelling and the reference mechanism \mbox{(MCM v3.2)}.

%MCM
The Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) \citep{Jenkin:1997, Jenkin:2003, Saunders:2003, Bloss:2005, MCM_Site} is a near-explicit mechanism describing the degradation of 125 primary VOCs. 
The latest version, \mbox{MCM v3.2}, is the reference mechanism in this study.

%CRI
The second version of the Common Representative Intermediates (CRI v2) \citep{Jenkin:2008} is a reduced chemical mechanism describing the oxidation of the same primary VOCs as MCM v3.1, the previous MCM version. 
VOC degradation is represented through species whose \ce{O3} production reflects that of the \mbox{MCM v3.1}. 
The \mbox{CRI v2} full version (\url{http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/CRI}) was used.

Differences in \ce{O3} production between the CRI v2 and MCM v3.2 may be due to changes in the MCM versions rather than the CRI v2 reduction techniques.
For this reason, the MCM v3.1 was also included.

%MOZART
The Model for OZone and Related chemical Tracers version 4 (MOZART-4) is a global chemical transport model including representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry \citep{Emmons:2010}. 
Methane, ethane, propane, ethene, propene, isoprene and $\alpha$-pinene are represented by non-lumped model species. 
The mechanism species BIGALK, BIGENE and TOLUENE represent all other VOC. 
The choice of mechanism species is based on the functional group of the VOC.

%RADM2
The second generation Regional Acid Deposition Model (RADM2) was developed for regional scale atmospheric chemistry modelling \citep{Stockwell:1990}. 
Methane, ethane, ethene and isoprene are represented by explicit model species. 
All other VOCs are split into lumped mechanism species based upon OH-reactivity and molecular weight.

%RACM
RADM2 was updated to the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM) \citep{Stockwell:1997}. 
Updates include more explicit and mechanism species representing VOCs as well as revised rate constants and product yields. 
Aromatic, PAN and isoprene chemistry was also revised.

%RACM2
RACM2 is the current RACM version \citep{Goliff:2013} with substantial updates to aromatic and ketone chemistry. 
More mechanism and explicit species representing emitted VOC are included leading to a more detailed mechanism than its previous versions.

%CBM4
The Carbon Bond Mechanism version four (CBM-IV) was developed for simulations of urban polluted conditions \citep{Gery:1989}. 
Ethene, formaldehyde and isoprene are the only VOCs represented by explicit species. 
All other emitted VOC are lumped according to their carbon bond types. 

Primary VOC initial mixing ratios were assigned the appropriate representation as described in \citet{Hogo:1989}. 
For example, pentane has five single carbon bonds and is represented as $5$ PAR, where PAR represents carbon with only single bonds. 
An initial mixing ratio of $1,200$ pptv was assigned as \mbox{$6,000$ ($= 1,200 \times 5$) pptv} in CBM-IV.

%CB05
The fifth version of the Carbon Bond Mechanism (CB05) \citep{Yarwood:2005} includes species representing methane, ethane and acetaldehyde. 
Revised chemistry schemes including peroxide formation occuring in VOC-sensitive regions is now present.
Allocation of some primary VOC to mechanism species was also updated.

%general info
The modelling approach and set-up followed the original TOPP study \citep{Butler:2011}.
A summary is provided with further details in the supplement and \citet{Butler:2011}. 
Radical and \ce{NO_x} amounts were balanced at each time step by NO emissions equalling the total radical source minus the total \ce{NO_x} source.
NO emission amounts were determined separately for each model run ensuring maximum \ce{O3} production conditions for each mechanism.

%initial conditions
The NMVOC and their initial mixing ratios are those of Los Angeles taken from \citet{Baker:2008}. 
Initial NMVOC mixing ratios were held constant until midday of the first day and then left to react freely. 
Methane (\ce{CH4}) was held fixed at \mbox{$1.8$ ppmv}. 
Carbon monoxide (CO) and \ce{O3} were initialised at \mbox{$200$ ppbv} and \mbox{$40$ ppbv} respectively and then allowed to evolve freely.

Table \ref{t:initial_conditions} outlines the NMVOC used in the study, their initial mixing ratios and representation in the different mechanisms.
The mechanism assignment of each NMVOC followed the recommendations for each mechanism.
Initial mixing ratios were weighted by carbon number of the mechanism species when lumping NMVOC into mechanism species. 
This ensured the initial amount of reactive carbon was constant between model runs.

\subsubsection{Mechanism Implementation} %implementation of mechanisms for the runs

The MECCA boxmodel \citep{Sander:2005} is based upon the Kinetic Pre-Processor (KPP) \citep{Damian:2002} and was used as described in \citet{Butler:2011}. 
Hence, all chemical mechanisms were adapted into modularised KPP format.

MCM v3.2 inorganic chemistry was used in each model run to focus on the organic NMVOC degradation chemistry.
Inorganic gas-phase chemistry is relatively well-known and any differences are typically due to inconsistencies between IUPAC and JPL reaction rate constants \citep{Emmerson:2009}.

Some mechanisms include reactions only important in the stratosphere or free troposphere. 
Such reactions were not included as this study is concerned with processes below the planetary boundary layer. 
For example, PAN photolysis is important in the free troposphere and removed from MOZART-4, RACM2 and CB05 \citep{Harwood:2003}.  

The MCM v3.2 approach to photolysis, dry deposition and \ce{RO2}--\ce{RO2} reactions was used for each mechanism. 
Details of this implementation are found in the supplement.

\subsection{Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP)}
This section summarises the tagging methodology described in \citet{Butler:2011} which should be consulted for more details.

\subsubsection[Tagging Approach and Application to Ox Family]{Tagging Approach and Application to \ce{O_x} Family} \label{ss:tagging} %tagging of mechanisms

Tagging follows the degradation of all NMVOCs in Table \ref{t:initial_conditions} through all possible pathways. 
The chemical mechanisms were re-written with every organic degradation product labelled with the name of the emitted NMVOC. 
Thus, each NMVOC had its own set of degradation reactions \citep{Butler:2011}.

    \caption{Day-time \ce{O_x} production budgets using the MCM v3.2 (a) without tagging and \mbox{(b) with} tagging, where \ce{O_x} production is attributed to the emitted VOCs.}
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:Ox_budget}
\end{figure} 

%adapt to include Ox family
The odd oxygen family, \ce{O_x}, is used to remove the influence of rapid cycles on \ce{O3} budgets \citep{Seinfeld:2006}. 
We define \ce{O_x} to include \ce{O3}, \ce{NO2}, \ce{O(^3P)}, \ce{O(^1D)} and other chemical species that are involved in fast photochemical cycles with \ce{O3} and \ce{NO2}, such as PAN (peroxy acetyl nitrate).

The tagging approach allows production budget allocation to emitted NMVOCs. 
Without tagging, the individual reactions producing \ce{O_x} can be determined but not the organic reactant NMVOC sources. 
Examining the organic degradation product tags determines the NMVOC source as illustrated in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:Ox_budget}}.

\subsubsection{Tagged Ozone Production Potential (TOPP) Definition} %final definition of TOPP

The TOPP is the ratio of \ce{O_x} molecules produced per emitted VOC molecule.  
Daily TOPP values were calculated by determining the total daily contribution to \ce{O_x} production from a VOC and then normalising by its total emissions on the first day of the model run. 
The \ce{O_x} production was allocated to each VOC using the tags as described in \mbox{Section \ref{ss:tagging}}.
