Figure \ref{f:time_series} shows the time series of \ce{O3} mixing ratios obtained with each mechanism.
The day-time \ce{O_x} production budgets allocated to VOC for each mechanism are displayed in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets}}.
The \ce{O_x} production from lumped mechanism species is re-assigned to the base VOC of \mbox{Table \ref{t:initial_conditions}} by applying a contributing factor to the \ce{O_x} production of the lumped species.
For example, TOL in RACM2 represents both toluene and ethylbenzene with contributing factors of $0.868$ and $0.132$.
The \ce{O_x} production of toluene and ethylbenzene in RACM2 are determined by multiplying the \ce{O_x} production from TOL by these factors.

The mechanisms with the most detailed chemistry (MCM v3.2, MCM v3.1 and CRI v2) produce the largest amount of \ce{O3} (Figure \ref{f:time_series}).
Whilst CBM-IV and CB05, with the least chemical detail, produce the lowest amount of \ce{O3}.
This trend is mirrored in Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets} where the more detailed mechanisms produce more \ce{O_x} than less detailed mechanisms.

The \ce{O3} mixing ratios on the first day in RACM are lower than mechanisms having similarly detailed chemistry (such as MOZART-4 or RADM2).
The lower \ce{O3} mixing ratios are due to a lack of \ce{O_x} production from aromatic VOC on the first day in RACM (Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets}).
Aromatic degradation chemistry in RACM results in net \ce{O_x} consumption on the first day, this is detailed in \mbox{Section \ref{sss:aromatic}}.

Low \ce{O_x} production in CBM-IV and CB05 is related to lower OH mixing ratios compared to the MCM v3.2. 
Higher NO emissions are required for maximal \ce{O_x} production in CBM-IV and CB05 than the MCM v3.2, producing more \ce{HNO3} \reactionref{r:NO2_OH} which removes \ce{NO2} and OH through \ce{HNO3} deposition.
The NO emissions required for maximal \ce{O_x} production in each mechanism are compared in Section \ref{ss:radicals}.
Lower \ce{O3} levels using CBM-IV and CB05 compared to other mechanisms have also been noted in previous modelling studies such as \citet{Luecken:2008, Emmerson:2009} and \citet{Saylor:2012}.

\subsection{First Day Ozone Production} \label{ss:day1} %first day comparison

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/first_day_values}
    \vspace{1mm}
    \caption{The first day TOPP values for each VOC calculated using MCM v3.2 and the corresponding values in each mechanism. The root mean square error (RMSE) of each set of TOPP values is also displayed.}
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:first_day}
\end{figure}

The first day TOPP values of each VOC calculated from each mechanism are compared to those obtained with the MCM v3.{2} in Figure \ref{f:first_day}.
The root mean square error (RMSE) of all first day TOPP values in each mechanism from those in the MCM v3.2 are also included.
The RMSE values show that reduced mechanisms have a higher spread in their first day TOPP values than the MCM v3.1 and CRI v2.
The higher RMSE values are mainly due to the lower TOPP values obtained for aromatic VOC in reduced mechanisms.

The first day TOPP value of $2$-methylpropene in RACM, RACM2, MOZART-4 and CB05 indicate that it degrades differently to the MCM v3.2. 
The variation between RACM, RACM2 and MCM v3.2 arises from differences in the ozonolysis rate constant of $2$-methylpropene.
This rate constant is an order of magnitude faster in RACM and RACM2 than in MCM v3.2 as the RACM, RACM2 rate constant is a weighted mean of all the ozonolysis rate constants of all VOC represented as OLI \citep{Stockwell:1997, Goliff:2013}.
The faster rate constant produces more radicals in RACM and RACM2 producing more \ce{O_x} than the MCM v3.2.

The MOZART-4 degradation of $2$-methylpropene produces acetaldehyde (\ce{CH3CHO}) through the reaction of NO with the $2$-methylpropene peroxy radical.
Whereas no \ce{CH3CHO} is produced during $2$-methylpropene degradation in MCM v3.2.
\ce{CH3CHO} initiates an \ce{O_x}-producing degradation chain involving \ce{CH3CO3} and \ce{CH3O2} producing more \ce{O_x} in MOZART-4 than \mbox{MCM v3.2}.

The $2$-methylpropene representation in CB05 was updated to \mbox{HCHO + $3$ PAR} from \mbox{\ce{CH3CHO} + HCHO + PAR} in CBM-IV, where PAR is the paraffin \ce{C-C} bond \citep{Gery:1989, Yarwood:2005}.
The representation in CB05 includes more of the slower reacting PAR at the expense of the more reactive \ce{CH3CHO} promoting lower \ce{O_x} production than the MCM v3.2.

\subsection{Ozone Production on Subsequent Days} \label{ss:profiles} %TOPP time series of all species

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{img/TOPP_daily_time_series_all_VOC}

    \caption{TOPP value time series for all NMVOCs obtained with each mechanism.}
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:TOPP_dailies}
\end{figure}

Time series of daily TOPP values for each NMVOC are presented in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}}. 
NMVOC such as ethene, whose degradation is described using dedicated mechanism species show similar time-dependent \ce{O_x} production in all mechanisms.
Higher variability in the time dependent \ce{O_x} production is evident for all aromatic VOC and those NMVOC represented by lumped mechanism species, such as pentane.

\ce{O_x} production from alkane degradation has a second day maximum that increases with carbon number in CRI v2 and both MCM mechanisms (Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}).
This second day increase in \ce{O_x} production is reproduced by the reduced mechanisms but the magnitude of this increase is not -- this is most pronounced for hexane, heptane and octane.
Hexane, heptane and octane are represented by lumped species in all reduced mechanisms, except CRI v2 and the \ce{O_x} production during the degradation of these lumped species has a significantly lower total \ce{O_x} yield than the explicit species representing these alkanes.
The total \ce{O_x} yield of hexane, heptane and octane in each mechanism is found in the supplement to the paper.

All aromatic VOC are represented as toluene in MOZART-4, this leads to overestimating the \ce{O_x} production from less reactive VOC (benzene) and also underestimating the \ce{O_x} production from more reactive aromatic VOC (xylenes).
Aromatic VOC in RADM2 and RACM are represent as either toluene or xylene depending on the \textit{k}$_{\text{OH}}$ of the VOC.
This approach also leads to an over-estimation of the \ce{O_x} production from benzene and ethylbenzene but fares better for the \ce{O_x} production from the xylenes.
There is no \ce{O_x} production from aromatic VOC in RACM due to a change in degradation chemistry that leads to \ce{O_x} consumption, details are found in \mbox{Section \ref{sss:aromatic}}.
\ce{O_x} production from all aromatic VOC in CBM-IV and CB05 is much lower than in MCM v3.2 due to a combination of rapid loss of reactive carbon and a low \ce{O_x} Production Efficiency (OxPE, the ratio of \ce{O_x} production to \ce{O_x} loss).
Details of the reactive carbon loss and OxPE for toluene are found in Sections \ref{ss:carbon_loss} and \ref{ss:OxPE}.

\subsubsection[Ox Production during Toluene Degradation]{\ce{O_x} Production during Toluene Degradation} \label{sss:aromatic}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.98\textheight]{img/TOL_Ox_intermediates}
    \vspace{0mm}
    \caption{Day-time \ce{O_x} production and consumption budgets allocated to the responsible reactions from toluene degradation in all mechanisms.}
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:toluene_Ox}
\end{figure}

\ce{O_x} production during toluene degradation in Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies} has the largest spread between all mechanisms.
In order to explain the reasons for the large spread in \ce{O_x} production the day-time \ce{O_x} production and consumption budgets due to toluene degradation are shown in Figure \ref{f:toluene_Ox}.
The \ce{O_x} production and consumption during toluene degradation are allocated to the responsible reactions by following the tags in each mechanism.

All reduced mechanisms except CRI v2, are unable to produce similar amounts of \ce{O_x} as the MCMv3.2.
The lower amounts of \ce{O_x} produced in reduced mechanisms is constrained by their rapid loss of reactive carbon during degradation of toluene, this analysis is described in Section \ref{ss:carbon_loss}.
Reduced mechanisms have a similar or lower \ce{O_x} production efficiency to the MCM v3.2 as highlighted in Section \ref{ss:OxPE}, in the case of toluene degradation this lower OxPE does not compensate enough for the loss of reactive carbon leading to lower \ce{O_x} production.

The \ce{O_x} production in CRI v2 and RACM2 reaches its maximum on the second day which differs from the MCM v3.2 which produces peak \ce{O_x} on the first day.
The second day maximum of \ce{O_x} production in CRI v2 and RACM2 results from additional \ce{C2H5O2} (C2H5O2 in CRI v2 and ETHP in RACM2) production that is not found in MCM v3.2.
The extra \ce{C2H5O2} production results from differing treatments to the MCM v3.2 in the degradation of unsaturated dicarbonyls producing during toluene degradation.

In CRI v2, unsaturated dicarbonyls from toluene degradation produce propionaldehyde (\ce{C2H5CHO}) leading to \ce{C2H5O2}.
Another degradation pathway for unsaturated dicarbonyls in CRI v2 produces the HOCH2CH2O2 peroxy radical which is also an additional \ce{O_x} source unique to CRI v2 in Figure \ref{f:toluene_Ox}.

Unsaturated dicarbonyls in RACM2 also lead to production of \ce{C2H5CHO} but this is reached via different pathways to the CRI v2.
\ce{C2H5CHO} is produced through the degradation of higher peroxides (OP2) and propyl peroxy radical (HC3P) which are degradation products of unsaturated dicarbonyl, in addition to \ce{C2H5CHO} production directly from unsaturated dicarbonyl degradation.

RACM chemistry results in net \ce{O_x} loss on the first two days in contrast to net \ce{O_x} production in the MCM v3.2 due to several \ce{O_x}-consuming reactions in RACM that are not present in the MCM.
Ozonolysis of the cresol OH-adduct mechanism species ADDC contributes the most to \ce{O_x} loss in RACM.
This reaction was included in RACM due to improved cresol product yields when comparing RACM predictions with experimental data \citep{Stockwell:1997}, other mechanisms that include cresol OH-adduct species do not include ozonolysis.
Including ozonolysis of aromatic OH-adduct species in RACM results in non-representative \ce{O_x} production, these ozonolysis reactions are not included in the updated RACM2.

\subsection{Production of Radicals} \label{ss:radicals}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.98\textheight]{img/radical_NOx_production_budgets}
    \vspace{0mm}
    \caption{Net radical production day-time budgets for each mechanism. Net radical production calculated as the difference between radical and \ce{NO_x} yields. O1D represents the reaction of \ce{O(^1D)} with water vapour.}
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:radical_production} 
\end{figure} 

Production of radicals impacts \ce{O_x} production by the conversion of NO to \ce{NO2} by peroxy radicals produced from VOC degradation that is typically initiated through OH reaction.
In this study, the amount of NO emissions are also affected by radical production as described in Section \ref{ss:model_setup} conditions of maximal \ce{O_x} production are achieved for each mechanism by emitting the amount of NO required to balance the source of radicals at each time step. 

In order to investigate the differences in NO emissions required by each mechanism to achieve maximal \ce{O_x} production, the net radical to \ce{NO_x} production budgets allocated to the contributing reactions are presented in Figure \ref{f:radical_production}.
The net radical to \ce{NO_x} production budgets were determined using the same calculation that was used to calculate the amount of NO emitted at each time step and hence the net radical production budgets in Figure \ref{f:radical_production} directly correlate to the amount of NO emitted during each mechanism's model run.

CBM-IV and CB05 were developed for the high-\ce{NO_x} conditions of urban and polluted regions \citep{Gery:1989, Yarwood:2005} and both mechanisms represent VOC-sensitive chemistry.
The representation of VOC-sensitive chemistry in CBM-IV and CB05 leads to much higher net radical production on the first two days corresponding to larger NO emissions than any other mechanism.
The higher NO emissions in CBM-IV and CB05 limit the amount of OH available for initiating VOC degradation as larger amount of \ce{HNO3} are produced through \reactionref{r:NO2_OH}.
\ce{HNO3} production also removes \ce{NO_x} from the system which constrains the amount of NO available for reaction with \ce{RO2} that would produce \ce{O_x}.

Photolysis of carbonyl species, mainly HCHO, is the main source of radicals from organic chemistry.
Reduced mechanisms do not include as many carbonyl species as more explicit mechanisms --- CBM-IV with 2 and RACM2 with 17 carbonyl species represent the lower and upper limits the number of carbonyl species in reduced mechanisms (besides the CRI v2).
The lack of carbonyl species in non-CRI v2 reduced mechanisms means that these reduced mechanisms produce radicals through other reactions such as initial VOC oxidation, NO--\ce{RO2} reactions and ozonolysis.
Examples of radical sources through non-photolysis pathways in reduced mechanisms are given in Table \ref{t:thermal_radicals}.

The mechanisms compared here require different NO emissions to simulate \ce{NO_x}-VOC-sensitive conditions, where the source of radicals is balanced by the source of \ce{NO_x}.
Thus, a constant NO source may lead to different atmospheric regimes (\ce{NO_x}- or VOC-sensitive) being simulated depending on the mechanism, this shall be investigated in future work.
