Figure \ref{f:time_series} shows the time series of \ce{O3} mixing ratios obtained with each mechanism.
There is an \mbox{$8$ ppbv} difference in \ce{O3} mixing ratios on the first day between RADM2 (highest \ce{O3}) and RACM2, which has the lowest \ce{O3} mixing ratios not considering the outlier time series of RACM.
The \ce{O3} mixing ratios in the CRI v2 are higher than those in the MCM v3.1, mirroring the results of \citet{Jenkin:2008}.

The day-time \ce{O_x} production budgets allocated to VOC for each mechanism are shown in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets}}.
The trends in \ce{O3} mixing ratios are mirrored in Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets} where mechanisms producing high amounts of \ce{O_x} have high \ce{O3} mixing ratios.

The first day mixing ratios of \ce{O3} in RACM are lower than other mechanisms due to a lack of \ce{O_x} production from aromatic VOC on the first day in RACM (Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets}).
Aromatic degradation chemistry in RACM results in net loss of \ce{O_x} on the first day, described later in \mbox{Section \ref{sss:day1}}.

RADM2 is the only reduced mechanism producing higher \ce{O3} mixing ratios than more detailed mechanisms (MCM v3.2, MCM v3.1 and CRIv2).
The higher mixing ratios of \ce{O3} in RADM2 are due to increased \ce{O_x} production from propane, butane and $2$-methylpropane (Figure \ref{f:Ox_tagged_budgets}).
Each of these alkanes are represented as HC3 in RADM2 \citep{Stockwell:1990}.
HC3 degradation produces more the (\ce{CH3CHO}) than the MCM v3.2 which leads to more \ce{O_x} production in RADM2 through reactions of \ce{CH3CO3} and \ce{CH3O2} with NO.

\end{figure}
%
Time series of daily TOPP values for each VOC are presented in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}}. 
Higher variability in the time dependent \ce{O_x} production is evident for VOC represented by lumped mechanism species.
For example, $2$-methylpropene is represented in reduced mechanisms by lumped species and has a higher spread in its time dependent \ce{O_x} production than ethene which is represented explicitly in each mechanism.
The lumped intermediate mechanism (CRI v2) produces the most similar \ce{O_x} to the \mbox{MCM v3.2} for each VOC.

In general, aromatic and unsaturated species have their largest differences between mechanisms on the first day of the simulations, while alkanes show their largest inter-mechanism differences in \ce{O_x} production on the second and third days of the simulations.
\mbox{Section \ref{sss:day1}} examines differences in first day \ce{O_x} production between the chemical mechanisms and \mbox{Section \ref{sss:profiles}} examines the differences in \ce{O_x} production on subsequent days.

    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:first_day}
\end{figure}
%
The first day TOPP values of each VOC, representing ozone production from freshly emitted VOC near their source region, from each mechanism are compared to those obtained with the MCM v3.{2} in Figure \ref{f:first_day}.
The root mean square error (RMSE) of all first day TOPP values in each mechanism relative to those in the MCM v3.2 are also included in Figure \ref{f:first_day}.  
The RMSE values show that lumped structure and lumped molecule mechanisms have a higher spread in their first day \ce{O_x} production than the CRI v2, which lumps intermediate species.

Aromatic VOC in reduced mechanisms are represented by mechanism species describing the degradation chemistry of many other aromatic VOC.
For example, all aromatic VOC in MOZART-4 are represented as toluene, thus less reactive aromatic VOC, such as benzene, produce higher \ce{O_x} whilst more reactive aromatic VOC, such as the xylenes, produce less \ce{O_x} in MOZART-4 than in the \mbox{MCM v3.2}.
RACM2 includes explicit species representing benzene, toluene and each xylene resulting in \ce{O_x} production from aromatic VOC that is the most similar to the MCM v3.2 than other reduced mechanisms.

\ce{O_x} production during toluene degradation has a high spread on the first day in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}} indicating that aromatic degradation is treated differently between mechanisms.
The reactions contributing to \ce{O_x} production and loss during toluene degradation are determined by following the ``toluene'' tags in each mechanism and are compared in Figure \ref{f:toluene_Ox}.

    \label{f:toluene_Ox}
\end{figure}
%
Toluene degradation in RACM includes several reactions consuming \ce{O_x} that are not present in the MCM resulting in net \ce{O_x} loss on the first two days.
Ozonolysis of the cresol OH-adduct mechanism species ADDC contributes significantly to \ce{O_x} loss in RACM.
This reaction was included in RACM due to improved cresol product yields when comparing RACM predictions with experimental data \citep{Stockwell:1997}. 
Other mechanisms that include cresol OH-adduct species do not include ozonolysis.
Including ozonolysis of aromatic OH-adduct species in RACM results in non-representative \ce{O_x} production, these ozonolysis reactions are not included in the updated RACM2.

The total \ce{O_x} produced on the first day during toluene degradation in all reduced mechanisms is less than that in the MCM (Figure \ref{f:toluene_Ox}).
Less \ce{O_x} is produced in all lumped structure and lumped molecule mechanisms due to a faster break down into smaller fragments than the MCM, described later in \mbox{Section \ref{ss:products}}.
In CBM-IV and CB05, less \ce{O_x} is produced during toluene degradation as the reactions of the toluene degradation products \ce{CH3O2} and CO with NO and OH, respectively, contribute less to the \ce{O_x} production budgets than in any other mechanism (Figure \ref{f:toluene_Ox}).

Maximum \ce{O_x} production from toluene degradation in CRI v2 and RACM2 is reached on the second day unlike the MCM v3.2 which produces peak \ce{O_x} on the first day.
The second day maximum of \ce{O_x} production in CRI v2 and RACM2 from toluene degradation results from increased \ce{C2H5O2} production from degradation of unsaturated dicarbonyls whereas this is not produced during degradation of unsaturated dicarbonyls in the MCM v3.2.

Unsaturated VOC generally produce similar amounts of \ce{O_x} between mechanisms, especially VOC represented explicitly, such as ethene and isoprene.
\ce{O_x} production from unsaturated VOC that are not represented explicitly, such as $2$-methylpropene, shows greater variation (Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}).

The first day TOPP values of $2$-methylpropene in RACM, RACM2, MOZART-4, CBM-IV and CB05 signify differences in its degradation to the MCM v3.2 (Figure \ref{f:first_day}).
The variation between RACM, RACM2 and MCM v3.2 arises from differences in the ozonolysis rate constant of $2$-methylpropene.
This rate constant is an order of magnitude faster in RACM and RACM2 than in MCM v3.2 as the RACM, RACM2 rate constant is a weighted mean of the ozonolysis rate constants of each VOC represented as OLI \citep{Stockwell:1997, Goliff:2013}.
The faster rate constant promotes increased radical production leading to more \ce{O_x} in RACM and RACM2 than the MCM v3.2.

$2$-methylpropene is represented as BIGENE in MOZART-4. 
The degradation of BIGENE produces \ce{CH3CHO} through the reaction between NO and the $2$-methylpropene peroxy radical, whereas no \ce{CH3CHO} is produced during $2$-methylpropene degradation in the MCM v3.2.
\ce{CH3CHO} \mbox{initiates a} degradation chain producing \ce{O_x} involving \ce{CH3CO3} and \ce{CH3O2} leading to more \ce{O_x} in MOZART-4 than \mbox{MCM v3.2}.

CBM-IV and CB05 represent $2$-methylpropene as a combination of aldehydes and PAR, the \ce{C-C} bond \citep{Gery:1989, Yarwood:2005}.
This representation of $2$-methylpropene does not produce the $2$-methylpropene peroxy radical, whose reaction with NO is the main source of \ce{O_x} production in all other mechanisms.

In RACM2, less \ce{O_x} is produced during the degradation of VOC represented by lumped molecule species due to increased loss rates of reactive carbon on the first day during VOC degradation compared to the MCM.
The loss rates of reactive carbon are shown for pentane and toluene in Section \ref{ss:products} and for other lumped mechanism species in the supplement to this paper.

Non-explicit representations of aromatic and unsaturated VOC coupled with differing degradation chemistry and a fast break down into smaller fragments results in different \ce{O_x} production in lumped molecule and lumped structure mechanisms compared to the MCM v3.2.
%
\subsubsection{Ozone Production on Subsequent Days} \label{sss:profiles} %TOPP time series of all species
%
Alkane degradation in CRI v2 and both MCM mechanisms produces a second day maximum in \ce{O_x} that increases with alkane carbon number (Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}).
The increase in \ce{O_x} production on the second day is reproduced for each alkane by the reduced mechanisms; except octane in RADM2, RACM and RACM2.
However, larger alkanes produce lower \ce{O_x} on the second day in each lumped molecule and lumped structure mechanism.

The lumped molecule mechanisms (MOZART-4, RADM2, RACM and RACM2) represent many alkanes by mechanism species which may lead to unrepresentative secondary chemistry for individual alkanes.
For example, as mentioned in Section \ref{ss:O3_time_series}, more \ce{O_x} is produced during the degradation of propane, butane and $2$-methylpropane in RADM2 than the MCM v3.2.
These alkanes are all represented in RADM2 by the lumped molecule species HC3 which also represents other classes of VOC, such as alcohols.

\end{figure}
%
As will be shown in Section \ref{ss:products}, another feature of lumped molecule mechanisms is that the breakdown of emitted VOC is faster than more explicit mechanisms.
In RADM2, RACM and RACM2, alkanes are broken down quicker than in the MCM by having a higher rate of reactive carbon loss (shown for pentane in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:net_carbon_loss}}), as many reactions during alkane degration do not conserve reactive carbon.
Despite many alkane degradation reactions in MOZART-4 almost conserving carbon, the organic products have less carbon than the organic reactant which also speeds up the breakdown of the alkane.
Figure \ref{f:HC5P_NO} shows the distribution of the number of carbon atoms of the organic products from the reaction of NO with the pentyl peroxy radical in the both MCM mechanisms, CRI v2 and each lumped molecule mechanism.
This reaction conserves reactive carbon in the CRI v2 and MCM mechanisms,  whilst in the lumped molecule mechanisms the majority of the organic products have less carbon than the organic reactant.
Moreover, in RADM2, RACM and RACM2 this reaction does not conserve reactive carbon.  

The faster breakdown of alkanes in lumped molecule mechanisms on the first day limits the amount of \ce{O_x} produced on the second day as less of the larger sized degradation products are available for further degradation and \ce{O_x} production.  
A further example of the speed of alkane breakdown impacting the amount of \ce{O_x} produced on the second day is octane in RADM2, RACM and RACM2 which does not produce peak \ce{O_x} on the second day, in contrast to all other mechanisms.
The break down of octane in RADM2, RACM and RACM2 on the first day proceeds so quickly that there are not enough degradation products available on the second day to produce more \ce{O_x} than on the first day, this is shown in the online supplement to this paper.

Lumped structure mechanisms (CBM-IV and CB05) represent alkanes by PAR, the \ce{C-C} bond, with the amount of PAR determined by multiplying the alkane initial condition by the number of carbons of the alkane.
This approach leads to a larger amount of unreacted PAR after the first day which then goes on to react with OH during the subsequent days of the simulation.
\mbox{Figure \ref{f:Unreacted_PAR}} shows the percentage of unreacted alkane in the CBM-IV, CB05, CRI v2 and the MCM mechanisms.
The lumped structure approach to alkane degradation produces similar amounts of \ce{O_x} on the first day to the MCM v3.2 (\mbox{Figure \ref{f:first_day}}) and similar \ce{O_x} production on subsequent days to the lumped molecule mechanisms (\mbox{Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}}).

    \label{f:carbon}
\end{figure}
%
The time dependent \ce{O_x} production of different VOC in Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies} results from the varying rates at which VOC break up into smaller fragments \citep{Butler:2011}.
Varying break down rates of VOC between mechanisms could explain the different time dependent \ce{O_x} production between mechanisms.
The break down of pentane and toluene between mechanisms is compared in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:carbon}} by allocating the \ce{O_x} production to the number of carbon atoms in the degradation products.
Some mechanism species in RADM2, RACM and RACM2 have fractional carbon numbers \citep{Stockwell:1990, Stockwell:1997, Goliff:2013} and \ce{O_x} production from these species was reassigned as \ce{O_x} production of the nearest integral carbon number.  

During degradation of pentane, a five-carbon VOC, more \ce{O_x} is produced from degradation products also having the five carbon atoms in explicit mechanisms throughout the model run (Figure \ref{f:carbon}).
Reduced mechanisms produce similar amounts of \ce{O_x} on the first day to the \mbox{MCM v3.2} by producing more \ce{O_x} from smaller degradation products.
The lower contribution of larger degradation products indicates that pentane is broken down faster in reduced mechanisms.

    \caption{Daily net carbon loss rate during pentane and toluene degradation.}
    \vspace{-4mm}
    \label{f:net_carbon_loss}
\end{figure}
%
The net loss rate of reactive carbon during pentane and toluene degradation is shown in \mbox{Figure \ref{f:net_carbon_loss}} and was determined by multiplying the rate of each reaction occurring during pentane and toluene degradation by its net carbon loss.
Pentane is broken down faster in each lumped molecule mechanism by losing reactive carbon more quickly than the MCM v3.2 (Figure \ref{f:net_carbon_loss}).
The faster break down of pentane on the first day limits the amount of reactive carbon available to produce further \ce{O_x} on subsequent days leading to lower \ce{O_x} production after the first day in reduced mechanisms.
Pentane degradation in CBM-IV and CB05 has a low rate of reactive carbon loss as pentane is represented by PAR, the \ce{C-C} bond whose degradation is described by C1 and C2 species.

As seen in Figure \ref{f:TOPP_dailies}, \ce{O_x} produced during toluene degradation has a high spread between all mechanisms.
Figure \ref{f:carbon} shows differing distributions of the sizes of the degradation products that produce \ce{O_x}.
All reduced mechanisms omit \ce{O_x} production from at least one degradation fragment size which produces \ce{O_x} in the MCM v3.2 indicating that toluene is also broken down more quickly than more explicit mechanisms.
For example, toluene degradation in RACM2 does not produce \ce{O_x} from degradation products with six carbons unlike the \mbox{MCM v3.2}.

All reduced mechanisms lose reactive carbon faster than the MCM v3.2 during toluene degradation.
Thus reduced mechanisms are unable to reach the \ce{O_x} production levels of explicit mechanisms.
Inclusion of more species that would reduce the net loss rate of reactive carbon would lead to more similar \ce{O_x} production to the MCM.
