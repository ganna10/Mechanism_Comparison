We show that simplified chemical mechanisms break down VOC into smaller sized degradation products on the first day faster than the near-explicit MCM chemical mechanism which would lead to an underprediction of ozone levels downwind of VOC emissions, and an underestimation of the VOC contribution to tropospheric background ozone when using simplified chemical mechanisms in regional or global modelling studies.
